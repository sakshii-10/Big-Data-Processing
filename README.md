# Big-Data-Processing
Spark-based analysis of Twitter, MovieLens, Chicago Taxi, and HDFS Logs

📡 **Big Data, Real Insights: Learning to Process at Scale with Spark**  
Over the past semester, I’ve explored how to turn **massive datasets into meaningful insights** using **Apache Spark** — from Twitter trends and movie ratings to taxi mobility and real-time log analytics.

📊 Here’s what I built and what I learned:

🔷 **📍 Twitter Data Analysis**  
- *Visual:* Scatter plot showing tweet distribution across U.S.  
- Insights on daily patterns, location-based behavior, and time-of-day tweet bursts.

🔷 **🎬 MovieLens Ratings**  
- *Visual:* Pie chart of rating categories (Low, Medium, High) and bar chart of genres  
- Discovered how users rate over time and which genres dominate.

🔷 **🚖 Chicago Taxi GraphFrames**  
- *Visual:* PageRank bar chart of top community areas + network graph showing connections  
- Modeled mobility patterns as a graph and identified urban hubs.

🔷 **🧾 HDFS Logs with Structured Streaming**  
- *Visual:* Line chart of DataNode activity over time + filtered log table with timestamp  
- Built a pipeline for real-time anomaly detection using watermarks and windowed operations.

🎯 **Key Takeaways:**
- Scalable analytics using **PySpark** and **GraphFrames**  
- Real-time data handling with **Structured Streaming**  
- Creating modular ETL workflows across domains  
- Gained hands-on experience with **geospatial**, **temporal**, **graph**, and **streaming** data

Proud of how much I’ve learned through ECS765P at **Queen Mary University of London**. Looking forward to applying these skills to solve real-world big data challenges! 🚀
